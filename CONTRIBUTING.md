# Contributing Guidelines for CancerDetectNet

## Introduction
Welcome to CancerDetectNet! I aim to build a community where contributors can share their custom-trained models to advance mammogram analysis.

## Preferred Contributions
- **Custom-Trained Models**: I highly encourage the contribution of models you've personally developed. Share your model files, training data (if possible), and a detailed explanation of your methodology.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork and Clone**: Start by forking the repo and cloning your fork.
2. **Model Contribution Branch**: Create a branch specifically for your model contribution.
3. **Prepare Your Contribution**: Include your model files, documentation on how you trained it, and any relevant performance metrics.
4. **Commit, Push, and Pull Request**: Commit your changes with clear messages. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Document how your model was trained and its performance metrics.
- Include a README with your model explaining its features, benefits, and any limitations.

## Community and Conduct
- I value respect and constructive feedback. Engage positively with fellow contributors.

## Support
For questions or support, open an issue with a detailed description of your inquiry.

I am very excited to see your contributions and to collaborate on making impactful advancements in mammogram analysis.
